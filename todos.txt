---------
preprocessing:
- analysis of EC
- revisar todos los analisis
- codi a català

logistic regression:
- codi a català
- evaluate again with new files
- fair treatment:
    - create model using the nn structure
    - evaluate against first model

neural networks:
- modify data loader
- modify train function
- make pickle work again (module does not seem to cooperate with me)
- evaluate again with new files

SOURCE CODE
-----------
- document utils (both_ways and elastic_centrality)
- create logistic regression training
- create neural networks training
- create scoring models script (any model saved by pickle)
- create saving function that ampliates the traces
