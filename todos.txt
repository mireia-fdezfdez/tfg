NOTEBOOKS
---------
preprocessing:
- generate *two* files, separate by random nodes to test on

logistic regression:
- evaluate again with new files
- fair treatment:
    - create model using the nn structure
    - evaluate against first model

neural networks:
- modify data loader
- modify train function
- make pickle work (module does not seem to cooperate with me)
- evaluate again with new files

SOURCE CODE
-----------
- uptade utils
- modify preprocessing -> generate two files accordingly
- create logistic regression training
- create neural networks training
- create scoring models script (any model saved by pickle)

REPORT
------
- everything (intro, objectives, preprocessing, eda, etc.)
